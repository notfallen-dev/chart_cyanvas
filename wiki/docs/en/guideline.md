## Rules

You must follow these rules when posting a chart.

### Originality

You must not post a chart that is a copy of an existing chart. Leaked charts are also prohibited.

Note that charts which have very simple modifications, such as adding a flick to all notes, are also prohibited.

### Completion

You must not publish unfinished charts. Violating this rule may result in an immediate ban.

You can upload an unfinished chart for testing, but that chart must be set to private. You should only publish charts that are finished.

### Allowed use of music

Some games, such as a certain new-dimension rhythm game, a certain drumming game, etc., do not allow fan-made charts using their songs.
Some composers also do not allow fan-made charts.
Charts using disallowed music will be deleted.

:::info
**For copyright owners who want to request deletion:**

You can request deletion from the #copyright-contacts channel in the Chart Cyanvas Discord server. Please join from the sidebar.
:::

### Inappropriate content

You must not post a chart that contains inappropriate content, such as religious, political, sexual, or other inappropriate content.

### Correct information

Your chart must have the correct information (Title, Composer, Artist, and BPM).
Do not use invalid information. (For example: writing "idk" in the composer field is not allowed)

### Others

All of these rules may be enforced at the discretion of the moderators.

## Warnings

You will be warned if you violate the rules above.
When the guideline is updated, if a chart violates the new guideline, it will not be deleted but will be hidden.

Multiple or severe violations may result in the deletion of your account and all charts associated with it, along with your Discord account being banned from the Chart Cyanvas Discord server. This means you will no longer be able to post your charts.

Chart Cyanvas is open sourced ([sevenc-nanashi/chart_cyanvas](https://github.com/sevenc-nanashi/chart_cyanvas)). You can host your own Chart Cyanvas instance with your own rules. If you have any complaints, please host your own instance.
